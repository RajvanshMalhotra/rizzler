# 💘 **Rizzler** — Actually Good Pickup Lines, Fine-Tuned at 3AM

A large language model fine-tuned to master the ancient art of charm — and finally put an end to pickup lines like "Are you Wi-Fi? Because I'm feeling a connection."

🤔 What Is This?
RizzGPT is a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained to generate pickup lines that don’t suck. Born out of a sleepless night and a series of deeply embarrassing chatbot outputs, this project aims to upgrade your  game with:

😌 Smooth

😎 Actually usable

pickup lines that might just work (no guarantees, but at least they won't make people cringe).

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a meme-turned-experiment. Use responsibly. Respect boundaries. Being a decent human > any line.

⭐ Star This Repo If…
...you've ever cringed at a pickup line and thought, “Even an AI could do better.”

future plans:
Making my own dataset with dialogues and well you gotta look out for this one suprises coming soon or so if time allows 😎💗.

Coincidence? Please. We don't do basic here. 😌
