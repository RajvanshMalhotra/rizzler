# 💘 **Rizzler** — Actually Good Pickup Lines, Fine-Tuned at 3AM

A large language model fine-tuned to master the ancient art of charm — and finally put an end to pickup lines like "Are you Wi-Fi? Because I'm feeling a connection."

🤔 What Is This?
RizzGPT is a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained to generate pickup lines that don’t suck. Born out of a sleepless night and a series of deeply embarrassing chatbot outputs, this project aims to upgrade your  game with:

😌 Smooth

😎 Actually usable

pickup lines that might just work (no guarantees, but at least they won't make people cringe).
